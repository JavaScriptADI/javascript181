1. Truth Table Practice: Write code to display the results of various logical operations (&&, ||, !) between two boolean variables.
2. Eligibility Checker: Create a condition that checks if a person is eligible to vote by checking their age and whether they have a valid ID.
3. Grading System: Implement a program that takes a score (0-100) and prints the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, F) using if, else if, and else statements
4. Number Comparison: Write code that compares a given number and prints whether it is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.
5. Print Numbers 1 to 10: Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
6. Sum of Even Numbers: Write a loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 20, using continue to skip odd numbers.
7. Break Example: Create a loop that runs indefinitely but breaks when a condition is met (e.g., a counter exceeds 5).
8. Create a program that takes two inputs: the current weather condition ("sunny", "rainy", or "snowy") and the temperature (in degrees Celsius). The program should:

Print "It's a perfect day!" if it is sunny and the temperature is between 20°C and 30°C.
Print "It's a good day, but stay hydrated!" if it is sunny and the temperature is above 30°C.
Print "Take an umbrella and wear a jacket" if it is rainy and the temperature is below 15°C.
Print "It's snowy, wear warm clothes and stay safe!" if it is snowy and the temperature is below 0°C.
If none of the above conditions are met, print "Check the weather conditions and stay prepared."
Ensure proper indentation and nested if structures where needed.
